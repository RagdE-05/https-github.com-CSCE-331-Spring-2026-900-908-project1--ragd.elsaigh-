      <h1>Services Offered</h1>
      <p>
        Giving back to my community is important to me, and as a student I can do so through my mentorship and volunteering.
        I also just love meeting new people and learning about them, so doing so while I help them grow is a plus!

      <h2>Tutoring</h2>
      <p>
        I work as a tutor for highschool students in ELA and Math subjects. Some things I've learned about my students is that
        they are great musicians (one of them play the harp), they are very polite, and they are great learners!

      <h2>Peer Mentoring</h2>
      <p>
        I help fellow students navigate school while upholding the Aggie Honor Code and understanding how to
        complete coursework and assessments the correct way. I provide useful studying advice or direct students to campus 
        resources relevant to their needs.

      <h2>Volunteering</h2>
      <p>
        I also love volunteering in my free time. I find it rewarding to help at the local animal shelter, where they have
        the cutest dogs and cats!
