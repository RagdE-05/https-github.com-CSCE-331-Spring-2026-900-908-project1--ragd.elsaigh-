      <h1>Welcome to my website, my name is Ragd,</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with a strong interest in bioinformatics and data science in general. 
        I like the versatility of CS and how it can be applied to multiple fields, and I hope to use it to advance current bioinformatics models. 
        My goal from this course is to meet new people and to improve my software development, team-working, and writing skills.

        I am a very creative person with a big sweet tooth. During Covid, I had nothing better to do, so I became a self-taught pastry chef. I will say 
        I can make some pretty good desserts, so I involuntarily became my family's caterer for our events and/or birthdays. In addition to baking, I also make art, I love painting,
        but I think I have more talent using colored pencils and graphite on normal paper. I tend to have better control with pencils so the images turn out to be more realistic.
        I guess a life lesson I've learned from my hobbies is: "beauty isn't defined by how complex or extravagant something is, simple things can be beautiful too!"
